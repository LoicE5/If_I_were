# If I were...

> Note : I made this project in 2020 as part of a school work. Using THREE.js wasn't required, it was my own choice. However, in that period, I was starting my programming journey and didn't know much about good programming practices. In October 2023, I updated it changing the language of the project (from French to English) and adapting the code to make it much more readable and maintainable. Enjoy :)

## About

Epitome of the self introduction, the 'If I were...' (also named 'Chinese Portrait') consists of multiple statements such as Â«Â If I was [something], I would be [something]Â Â». Not only a way to self-introduce to an audience, this project depicts a real artistic sight, not only through the choice of the statements, but also through the way to argue about these. It is even more relevant in a web format because the artistic aspect of the project meets technicality.

This project have been realized using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the ThreeJS library. I wanted to create something out of the box, so I decided to use the Z axis instead of the basics both vertical & horizontal axis for the user to navigate. In that way every text, illustration and sometimes audio appears to the user like he is navigating through a space field.
